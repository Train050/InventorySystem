Work completed in Sprint 2: 
In sprint 2, our group was able to improve the functionality of both the frontend and backend. Regarding the frontend development, we were able to develop a filter function to find specific data entries. In addition, we were able to get the table size changing feature working so rows shown can be adjusted. For the backend, we redesigned our initial code to be more simplified. We managed to get the SQlite database working with our tables, inventory and users, allowing for the creation of tuples. We were able to get GORM to communicate to the database and allow for the insertion, deletion, finding of tuples, and updating of the tuples within the tables. We also started integration of communication between backend and frontend. We established the routes that will use JSON to send information between frontend and backend. We lastly updated our code to include documentation for the use of each functions and their appropriate routes. Both frontend and backend also created several test cases to determine if the applications are working as expected.

Unit tests and Cypress tests for frontend:
