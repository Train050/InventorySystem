Work completed in Sprint 2: 
In sprint 2, our group was able to improve in both the frontend and backend. Regarding the frontend development, we were able to develop a filter function to find specific data entries. In addition, we were able to get the table size changing feature working so rows shown can be adjusted. For the backend, we redesigned our initial code to be more simplified. We managed to get the SQlite database working with tables inventory and users being created. We were able to get GORM to communicate to the database and allow for the insertion, deletion, and updating of the tuples within the tables. We also started integration of communication between backend and frontend.

Unit tests and Cypress tests for frontend:
