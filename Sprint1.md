User Stories:

Planned Goals:
Within this sprint, our team decided to try to get the basics of our application working. We set out to get the foundations of the inventory system working (i.e. the angular login page and database page) in addition to the user registration page. We also wanted to get the back end database started and a degree of communication between the back end components and front end.

Successfully completed goals:
Our group was able to get the pages for the inventory system, login page, and registration page set up. We were also able to get some of registration to work which involves communication between the front end and back end. 

Unsuccessful goals:
The team wasn't able to get the database system fully working and integrated into the front end environment so that users can register new accounts that work with the login page. The team is still trying to integrate the backend database into the inventory page so that new items can be added and then removed. We are also needing to correct the linking of the registration page to the registration button on the login page. We currently have a tab to demonstrate the login page but intend for only the button to remain to link the pages.
